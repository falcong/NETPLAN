1. Changed all electric gen flows in GWh... Some Gens with high CF had capacity as flow... I changed InvertEff file...
2. M$/Mgallon for XO-EO in OpCost.csv
3. Transportation --> Capacity to Flow limit conversion using trips/vehicle per year

Gen...

1. Inv - GW ($/GW)
2. OpMax- GWh (GW available * hours in simulation step * eff)
3. Flow - GWh (Decision variable)
4. GWh Flow affects $ and Emission ($/GWh... CO2/GWh)

Transportation...

1. Inv - vehicle ($/Vehcile) {1 vehicle = 1 trip of 1 mile}
2. OpMax- Total trips per year of all vehicles (Vehicles * trips/vehicle in simulation step // directly "total trips per year")
3. Flow - Total trips per year of all vehicles [Decision variable --> Flow * eff (occupancy factor) = demand served]
4. vehicle specific Trip (not pssenger car equivalents) Flow affects $ and Emission ($/Vehicle-mile... CO2/vehicle-mile)
    $/vehcile-mile * miles * Total trips (Flow variable)

Item 2. for transportation pending!!! - DONE!

- Check fleet inv limits?
- Check fleet inv cost?
- Connection to infrastructure to Fleet limits?
- Inv cost for infra...?
