# NETPLAN
National long-term Electric and Transportation Infrastructure Planning

NETPLAN's C++ code and data are available here and https://github.com/eibanez/NETPLAN. 
We will appreciate any users to credit the developers appropriately.

I (Venkat Krishnan (http://www.ece.iastate.edu/~vkrish/index.html)) was the lead developer of the National long-term Electric and Transportation infrastructure Planning software, NETPLAN from 2011-2014. NETPLAN was originally initiated by Dr. Eduardo Ibanez with Prof. James D. McCalley in 2009 for the $2 million NSF research project, NETSCORE-21 (short for “The 21st Century National Energy and Transportation Infrastructures Balancing Sustainability, Costs, and Resiliency” research project). 

NETPLAN is a long-term multi-sector multi-objective national infrastructure planning software, which helps to find the best electric and transportation infrastructure investments for the entire country for the next 40 years in terms of cost, sustainability, and resilience metrics.
